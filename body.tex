\section{Introduction}

The Legacy Survey of Space and Time is an optical/near-IR survey of half the sky in ugrizy bands to r 27.5 (36 nJy) based on 825 visits over a 10-year period: deep wide fast.
Carried out by Rubin observatory on Cerro Pcon Chile the survey will produce around 100 PB of data consisting of about a billion 16 Mpix images, enabling measurements for 40 billion objects! \cite{arXiv:0805.2366}

We have recently begun a pre operations program which includes exposing users to the Science Platform.
