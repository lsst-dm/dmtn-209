\title{Rubin Science Platform on Google: the story so far.}

% Note the position of the comma between the author name and the
% affiliation number.
% Authors surnames should come after first names or initials, eg John Smith, or J. Smith.
% Author names should be separated by commas.
% The final author should be preceded by "and".
% Affiliations should not be repeated across multiple \affil commands. If several
% authors share an affiliation this should be in a single \affil which can then
% be referenced for several author names. If only one affiliation, no footnotes are needed.
% See ManuscriptInstructions.pdf and ASP's manual2010.pdf 3.1.4 for more details

% There should be one \aindex line (commented out) for each author. These are used to
% build up the author index for the Proceedings. The surname must come first, followed by
% initials. Note the use of ~ before each initial to control spacing.
% The \author entries (see above) have surname last. These \aindex entries have
% surname first.
% The Aindex.py command willl create them for you after you have constructed the \author
% The first entry should be the first author, for bold-facing the author index page-reference
