In 2020 Rubin Observatory made a tender for a three year interim data facility. This was won by Google. In partnership with Google we have now deployed the first externally used version of the Rubin Science Platform consisting of a Jupyter environment and a portal. Sitting behind this is TAP access to our project developed large scale database Qserv holding a synthetic catalogue of 140 million objects  and around 500TB of simulated  images. The initial users were given access to this in July 2021.
